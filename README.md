# UATU - PostgreSQL

![I'm in ur databaes. Watchin ur codez.](/doc/img/uatu.png)

I watch the database and record what I see. 

I was originally started in powershell until someone told my author he needed to "_rewrite it in a real language like python_". My author is lazy and kept some of these older bits around. 

Precursors to me were written for MSSQL until someone gave my author a glass of Kool-aid and he abandoned the Gates sheeple for the word of our lord and saviour Linus.
